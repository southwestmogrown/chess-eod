# Design a Chess game using OOP & TDD

Use the specs provided and any errors to begin setting up your `pieces`
directory. Once all files are created you will be able to start seeing the specs.

You will want to start with the generic `piece` class as this is what all other
pieces will inherit from.

From there choose whichever piece you think you can tackle. Read the specs
carefully. Look at all of the existing files to see how the board and squares
work together.

This is by FAR more challenging than anything you will be expected to do, so
take it easy on yourself and try to have fun!
